# Trading Strategy
### Goal - //make money, but lots to consider aside from how to actually do it - at what risk, what timeframe, what portfolio percentage, crypto arbitrage, fees (m/t), portflios, risk of portfolios, current holdings, other allocated risk going on for other securities in TOS/other platform, hedging btc trades, buying and selling 'contract for difference' btc derrivatives, buying EFTs - gld/slv/other metals, etc

# Possible Considerations
### Exploration of statistical tools for dealing with non-normal distributions, specifically generalized hyperbolic distributions that have semi-heavy tails
### Dealing the events that can ocurr within these semi-heavy tails will be important to take into consideration
### Learn more about the skewed t
### Seeing where the GARCH model could fit in this system
### We'll need a useful understanding of the statistical behavior of specific types of ratios of random qualities
### Managing the active to passive trade ratio
### Trading dynamically across different exchanges based on optional transaction costs
### Setting "subjective" parameter thresholds to alert human (twilio) before, during, or after a trade that something's is going on or has already happened that the human will want to look at and make a decision
### Securing fastest, reliable internet possible while also incorporating failovers/safeties
### Security review program - accounts, passwords, networks, physical
